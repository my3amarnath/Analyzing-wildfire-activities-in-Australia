# Analyzing wildfire activities in Australia


## Introduction
This project focuses on exploring and analysing wildfire activities in Australia. Used visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn and Folium to create informative plots and charts.

## Dataset
**Historical Wildfires**

This wildfire dataset contains data on fire activities in Australia starting from 2005. Additional information can be found [here](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms/c6-mcd14dl).

Variables

- Region: the 7 regions
- Date: in UTC and provide the data for 24 hours ahead
- Estimated_fire_area: daily sum of estimated fire area for presumed vegetation fires with a confidence > 75% for a each region in km2
- Mean_estimated_fire_brightness: daily mean (by flagged fire pixels(=count)) of estimated fire brightness for presumed vegetation fires with a confidence level > 75% in Kelvin
- Mean_estimated_fire_radiative_power: daily mean of estimated radiative power for presumed vegetation fires with a confidence level > 75% for a given region in megawatts
- Mean_confidence: daily mean of confidence for presumed vegetation fires with a confidence level > 75%
- Std_confidence: standard deviation of estimated fire radiative power in megawatts
- Var_confidence: Variance of estimated fire radiative power in megawatts
- Count: daily numbers of pixels for presumed vegetation fires with a confidence level of larger than 75% for a given region
- Replaced: Indicates with an Y whether the data has been replaced with standard quality data when they are available (usually with a 2-3 month lag). Replaced data has a slightly higher quality in terms of locations

## Some Visualization Outputs

* This plot represents that the estimated fire area was on its peak after 2011, April and before 2012. You can verify on google/news, this was the time of maximum wildfire hit in Austrailia.![image](https://github.com/my3amarnath/Analyzing-wildfire-activities-in-Australia/assets/39696237/3d9aa834-cf96-4fac-a994-a7e44e08aa4f)
